# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`feat/...`) or fix branch (`fix/...`)
3. Keep changes focused and documented
4. Open a Pull Request with a clear description and screenshots/logs when relevant

## Coding notes

- Prefer small, reviewable commits
- Keep backward compatibility in mind (WordPress + PHP)
- Avoid committing secrets, `.env`, uploads, or `wp-config.php`
